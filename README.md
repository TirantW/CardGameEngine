# FrameWork

How to use our Framework:

This framework can be used to play a few existing card games, like “war, solitaire etc.”
You can make your own card games, and add rules to them. 

You can select and add rules to the card game by using Rules.java. In the class Rules, we have rules like: isHigher, isLower, doCardmatch and doCardsColorMatch. 
These are rules that most of the card games uses.
